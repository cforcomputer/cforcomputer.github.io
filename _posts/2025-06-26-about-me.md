## about Patrick
![Profile photo](assets\images\about-me\profile-shot.jpg)
*Taken in Amsterdam 2023*

Patrick O’Brien is originally from the United States, where he studied subjects like writing and digital forensic security at Edmonds College, then later Computer Science and Software Engineering, along with Interaction Design at the University of Washington. During the pandemic in 2020, Patrick decided to sell his belongings and pack his bags for Europe. He briefly studied Business Administration at the University of Amsterdam, living in a university provided hostel room for five months before going on a year long backpacking adventure through 25 countries. He worked on a sail ship, volunteered at farms, and lived in multiple cities.

Patrick is currently residing in Groningen, where he is building a new life for himself. He's now been working for the past two years at JC-Electronics as a Business Intelligence Analyst.

**Hell yeah.** 


### At Patrick's latest role he's: 

Developed a Python‑based bot using Playwright and proxies for an AI pricing system, automating competitor data collection and price recom‑
mendations across ∼30,000 products. This reduced manual processing time by an estimated 91%.

Built a Sveltekit webapp to locate desirable products to purchase using Ebay APIs & scraper database, 97% improvement in sourcing speed.

Successfully engineered solutions to latest anti‑botting tech by applying machine vision (Tesseract) for text extraction and novel human move‑
ment replay system for captcha solving with 100% success.

Spearheaded company‑wide adoption of git/github version control system, training employees on version control.

Improved flow run speed and stability in Alteryx, Tableau and SQL servers by over 80% using custom python scripts, clearing bottlenecks.

Automated stock lists, vendor inventory sync, and invoice handling company‑wide using SQL and Python, saving 15,000+ hours annually.

Created KPIs and novel interactive Tableau dashboards, while completing projects that had been in‑progress for years and thought impossible.

Automated product image background replacement using AI tools, eliminating the need for a then dedicated full time manual role.

Largely automated the refactoring of scrapers broken by site changes by adapting to advances in Large Language Model (LLM) workflows.

#### not only does Patrick have:

Experience building websites like this one for clients, from SEO optimization to E-Commerce shops

Business and sales experience as former [founder and CEO of Oakhold Group LLC](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_wa/604477197)

A broad range of experience in design, software, and customer-client interaction

A coder, videographer, drone operator, video editor, and micro-electronics and 3D printing enthusiast

### he is also:
 - Highly indepedent and results driven, does not overpromise and always delivers

 - Undeniably creative and sufficiently skilled to enact his creative visions

 - A creator, blending the worlds of art, business, and technology

 - A guy who loves learning from, as well as educating and giving back to his community and teammates


## past web design clients
**skills:**
- HTML
- Markdown
- CSS + Bootstrap
- Python
- Wordpress

Projects stacks are dependent on what the client is looking for. Usually they want to be able to edit posts themselves very easily. So I typically use Wordpress or other site builders, but spend extra time on custom themes. (A downside of teaching them to edit their own site is that they break things or make them look ugly later. I swear they were all originally very pretty!)
