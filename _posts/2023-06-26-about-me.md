![Profile photo](assets\images\about-me\profile-shot.jpg)


Patrick Oâ€™Brien is originally from the United States, where he studied subjects like writing and digital forensic security at Edmonds College, then later Computer Science and Software Engineering, along with Interaction Design at the University of Washington. During the pandemic in 2020, Patrick decided to sell his belongings and pack his bags for Europe.

Patrick is currently residing in Groningen, where he is building a new life for himself. 

**Hell yeah.** 

#### not only does Patrick have:

Experience building websites like this one for clients, from SEO optimization to E-Commerce shops

Business and sales experience as former [founder and CEO of Oakhold Group LLC](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_wa/604477197)

A broad range of experience in design, software, and customer-client interaction

A coder, videographer, drone operator, video editor, and micro-electronics and 3D printing enthusiast

### he is also:
 - Highly indepedent and results driven, does not overpromise and always delivers

 - Undeniably creative and sufficiently skilled to enact his creative visions

 - A creator, blending the worlds of art, business, and technology

 - A guy who loves learning from, as well as educating and giving back to his community and teammates


## past web design clients
**skills:**
- HTML
- Markdown
- CSS + Bootstrap
- Python
- Wordpress

Projects stacks are dependent on what the client is looking for. Usually they want to be able to edit posts themselves very easily. So I typically use Wordpress or other site builders, but spend extra time on custom themes. (A downside of teaching them to edit their own site is that they break things or make them look ugly later. I swear they were all originally very pretty!)
