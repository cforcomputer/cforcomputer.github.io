### uwbhacks 2020 (uwbhacks the cloud) - "Unemployer"
[view project](https://devpost.com/software/unemployer)

I was the organizer for this campus hackathon. I ran a team of over 20 people, learning valuable lessons in how to manage and organize individuals for a large project. We had weekly meetings for 6 months, along with additional specialized team meetings to address specific problems. 

2020 was the first year that UWB ACM received official sponsorships for the event. We were able to receive prizes for participants (free credits, physical prizes, and more) from DigitalOCean, Microsoft, and Google. We had employee volunteers attend from Microsoft and Google.

The event received over $12,000 in funding allocation from the University of Washington events committee, and we were allocated two buildings and an auditorium venue. We had over 300 attendee registrations, typically in the past we had seen upwards of 200 attendees. However, the event took place in May 2020, just after the start of the pandemic, so all physical events had to be canceled. 

The final event was held online, much of the plans had to be modified or scraped. We built a special website for the hackathon for user registrations. It was a moderate success, with around 100 attendees at its peak. I look forwards to applying the skills that I learned in other large projects, and now understand in depth the importance of involved and exceptional leadership to the success of a team project.

### defhacks 2019 - "Simblu"
[view project](https://devpost.com/software/simblu)

For this project we had to use a REST API from the event sponsor company Even. We decided to build a VR application that would replace the traditional Bloomberg terminal used in stock trading. The virtual Bloomberg terminal would allow users to view and sort the REST API data. I had the idea that websites could be monetized like an app store. You would purchase the VR version of a website within VR environment, allowing for increased functionality.

### dubhacks 2019
For dubhacks 2019 my group worked with artificial intelligence neural networks and computer vision to recognize doorframes in images using python, training our own model. 

### uwbhacks 2019 - "Crobber"
[view project](https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/CROBBER) | [watch video presentation](https://youtu.be/9xEMs7dKtNo)

I was a volunteer mentor for this event, helping other students complete their projects. With the other volunteer mentors, I helped to create a fun social media website for "crobs", which is a funny name for a crow. The common nesting ground for all of Seattle's crows is the University of Washington Bothell campus. Every night the skies run black with crows, and they cover everything, so we thought why not make them a social media platform?

### dubhacks 2018
[view project](https://github.com/mkhsu/PanoPro-Transcriber)

I worked on a team to develop Panopro. It's an application that would take the audio from live lectures and transcribe them to a text file. Once transcribed, it summarizes the key points of the lecture, writing the notes for you, whether you actually attended the lecture or not. I worked with a team of 5 people to complete the project during the two day event.

### uwbhacks 2018
I also volunteered for this event, helping out around the hackathon.
