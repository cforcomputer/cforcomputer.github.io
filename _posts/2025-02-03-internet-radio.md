### Internet radio project

#### My introduction to hardware prototyping

WIP post.

The internet radio was one of my first serious CAD projects where I attempted to build a fun enclosure for a full featured internet radio.

The radio can:
1. Act as a bluetooth speaker or BT to 3.5mm adapter
2. Create a wifi configuration portal
3. Allow the user to add any internet radio station
4. Act as a visualizer for music

I used Onshape for the 3D component of this project, and went through many iterations of the enclosure before I landed on one that was fully usable. 

I was surprised by how few working internet radio project there were. Most of the examples that I found were no longer functional or too limited. 
I forked a project that I found on youtube, but it was non-functional and I ended up redoing the entire thing with a different audio library.
